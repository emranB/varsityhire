  			or post something unique! Be sure to describe the job and its details
  			as accurately as possible so that students can give you a price offer.</p>

  			<h3>2.  Pick your price</h3>
  			<p>VARSITYHIRE advertises your job to all registered students in the area.
  			Interested students will send us their price offers and preferred time based
  			on the job information you have provided. We collect the offers and send them
  			to you, along with reviews of each student from past work. You then pick the
  			most suitable offer and we confirm with the respective student. All this happens
  			very quickly so that you, and the students, can plan for the upcoming week.
  			From there, we take care of the rest! </p>

  			<h3>3.  Relax, Let us do the heavy lifting!</h3>
  			<p> On the day of the arranged appointment, our students will show up to
  			complete the job. Don't worry, no payment is required until the job is complete
  			and satisfactory - quality guaranteed! We are also available 24/7 for any inquiries. Easy!</p>
